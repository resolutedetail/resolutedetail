- 👋 Hi, this is @resolutedetail
- 👀 I'm interested in SASE-cloud delivered security and understanding the ongoing convergence of network and security.  I enjoy threat hunting and tools and techniques.  
- 🌱 I’m currently learning network traffic analysis, powershell, and pentest techniques.  I'm interested in the network tapping in the cloud problem.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on network IDS/IPS (cloud & on-prem) and threat hunting tools.
- 📫 How to reach me ...
