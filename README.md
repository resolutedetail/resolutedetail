- 👋 Hi, this is Will @resolutedetail
- 👀 I'm interested in SASE-cloud delivered security and understanding the ongoing convergence of network and security.  I really enjoy threat hunting... and all the engineering and planning that goes with it. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning network traffic analysis, PowerShell for IR, and the problems involving cloud network traps and monitoring.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on network monitoring and threat hunting tools and techniques for both cloud and on-prem environments.

-  Why "resolutedetail" for a name?
-  In deciding this name - this branding - I wanted something that both represents my ancestry, my profession, and my values.  My earliest relatives immigrated to America from Germany before the first World War and passed down my given name through the generations.  This name comes from the Germanic root Wilhem, composed of the wil (will or desire) and helm (helmet or protection).

-  I noticed the phrase "resolute protector" in relation to my name and instantly thought, "a loyal soldier in the defense against cyber wrong doers!"  I kept 'resolute' and appended the word 'detail'.  Attention to detail is an action and a skill that demonstrates so many values.  It shows how much you care, like the Uber driver who provides bottled water and other comforts OR the script writer that included detailed comments.  It demonstrates a high level of situational awareness.  It saves time.  I associate it to ones integrity and respect.
