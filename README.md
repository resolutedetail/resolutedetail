- 👋 Hi, this is Will @resolutedetail
- 👀 I'm interested in SASE-cloud delivered security and understanding the ongoing convergence of network and security.  I really enjoy threat hunting... and all the engineering and planning that goes with it.  
- 🌱 I’m currently learning network traffic analysis, PowerShell for IR, and the problems involving cloud network traps and monitoring.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on network monitoring and threat hunting tools and techniques for both cloud and on-prem environments.
- 📫 How to reach me ...
